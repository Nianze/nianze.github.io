  "content": "Kodak 5222 double-x with Hexar RF and Zeiss ZM 25 f2.8\nIssue with self-loaded film on cameras with automatic film advancing function: the advancing motor will tear off the film from cassette at the end of the roll. This happened to me today so I have to unload the film in a darkroom. Need to find a better way to attach the bulk-loaded film onto the used cassette, otherwise I\u0026rsquo;ll have to stick with cameras with manual advance lever.\n",
