  "content": "The 80-20 rule states that 80 percent of a program\u0026rsquo;s resources are used by about 20 percent of the code.\n80% of the runtime is spent in approximately 20% of the code 80% of the memory is used by some 20% of the code 80% of the disk accesses are performed for about 20% of the code 80% of the maintenance effort is devoted to around 20 percent of the code To locate the critical pockets of code that are causing the problem, we should use the right way: using profilers.\nwe want profilers the directly measures the resources we are interested in (how much time is being spent in different parts of the program) knowing how often statements are executed or functions are called may sometimes yield insight into what our software is doing feed the profiler with representative input data - profiler can only tell how a program behaved on a particular run ",
