  "content": "Paul Lansky (born 1944) is an American composer, pioneering sound synthesis with computers since the mid-1960s. After 2004, he concentrated on instrumental composition without any electronic involvement.\nSounds originating from \u0026ldquo;real-world\u0026rdquo; sources are the predominant focus of Lansky\u0026rsquo;s computer music: traffic, kids in the kitchen, musical instruments, and most of all speech. Electronic synthesis is frequently used but the main sonic resources are transformations of recorded natural sounds.\nSix Fantasies on a Poem by Thomas Campion One of his first large pieces, Six Fantasies on a Poem by Thomas Campion (1979) set the stage. It is based on a reading by his wife Hannah MacKay of Thomas Campion’s famous poem Rose cheekt Lawra, which was published in 1602 as part of a treatise entitled Observations in the Art of English Poesie:\nRose-cheekt Lawra, come,\nSing thou smoothly with thy beawties\nSilent musick, either other\nSweetely gracing.\nLovely formes do flowe\nFrom concent devinely framed;\nHeav\u0026rsquo;n is musick, and thy beawties\nBirth is heavenly.\nThese dull notes we sing\nDiscords neede for helps to grace them;\nOnly beawty purely loving\nKnowes no discord;\nBut still mooves delight,\nLike cleare springs renu\u0026rsquo;d by flowing,\nEver perfect, ever in them-\nselves eternall.\nThe piece is a study of the contours of a live reading of the poem. In the Six Fantasies, the employment of electronic sound manipulation is not so much as a tool for creating yet-unheard sound, but rather introspectively, as a means of exploring the sonic environment of everyday human experience. A technique known as linear predictive coding (LPC) is used in the work. LPC was developed in the 1960s by scientists as a data-reduction technique meant to economize on the amount of data needed for digital voice transmission and is used today in some cell phone communication. It allows for the separation of pitch and speed and the pitch contours of the speech can be altered independently of the speed. Each of the six movements explores a different aspect of speech and is achieved by computer synthesized tape. The six pieces are, respectively:\nher voice her presence her reflection her song her ritual her self According to Paul Lansky\u0026rsquo;s Homepage on Princeton.edu:\nSpeech and song are commonly considered different and distinct \u0026ndash; as apples and oranges. It is my feeling, however, that they are more usefully thought of as occupying opposite ends of a spectrum, encompassing a wealth of musical potential. This fact has certainly not been lost on musicians: sprechstimme, melodrama, recitative, rap, blues, etc., are all evidence that it is a lively domain.\nSix Fantasies is my exploratory journey through this terrain. Each of the fantasies attempts to musically transform a single reading by Hannah MacKay of a well-known poem by Thomas Campion, and to musically highlight some aspect of her speech: contour, vowels, resonance, articulation, consonants, etc., explicating the implicit music within. The final fantasy largely reproduces the original reading, and it is my hope that by the time this rolls by that her speech will sound like music.\nReference: Ondishko, D. (1990).

oloists the Third Region (only) with orchestra (composed in 1969). This version of the Third Region can be performed by itself, or together with either the first or second version of the other three regions Each region uses certain anthems as centres:\nRegion I (dedicated to Pierre Boulez) has two: \u0026ldquo;The Internationale\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;La Marseillaise\u0026rdquo; Region II (dedicated to Henri Pousseur) has four: the German anthem, a group of African anthems, the opening of the Russian anthem, and a \u0026ldquo;subjective centre\u0026rdquo;, consisting of the recording of a moment during the studio work, \u0026ldquo;in which the present, the past and the pluperfect become simultaneous\u0026rdquo; (Stockhausen 1971, 96). Region III (dedicated to John Cage) has three: the continuation of the Russian anthem (the only one made entirely from electronic sounds), the American anthem, and the Spanish anthem. Region IV (dedicated to Luciano Berio) has just one, but it is a \u0026ldquo;double centre\u0026rdquo;: the Swiss anthem, whose final chord turns into an imaginary anthem of the utopian realm of \u0026ldquo;Hymunion in Harmondie under Pluramon\u0026rdquo; (Stockhausen 1971, 97).
