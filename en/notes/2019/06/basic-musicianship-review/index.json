To add a flat sign, count up four notes from root; to add a sharp, count up five notes. Chord Progressions Labelling: C Major Root Position: C = I C Major 1st Inversion: C/E = Ib = I6 = I6/3 C Major 2nd Inversion: C/G = Ic = I6/4 G7 1st Inversion: G7/B = Vb = V6/5 G7 2nd Inversion: G7/D = Vc = V4/3 G7 3rd Inversion: G7/F = Vd = V4/2 Meter Simple meters: the top number in the time signature is a 3 or divisible by 2 (e.g., 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 2/2, 3/2, 4/2). 4/4: simple quadruple, can be represented by a ‘C’, known as common time; 2/2 can be represented by ‘C’ with a vertical line through it, known as cut common time 2/4: simple duple meter. A bar consists of 2 crotchet beats 2/3: simple triple meter. A bar consists of 3 crotchet beats Compound meters: top number in the time signature is divisible by 3, by a number greater than 1 (e.g., 6/8, 9/8, 12/8). The rhythmic value that is defined in the bottom number of the time signature, is grouped in 3s, which gives them distinct feel Beams: lines that connect shorter note values and help to clearly display the main beats of a meter. Grouping: as a general rule, the main beats of the meter must be clearly visible within the displayed rhythm at all times ",
