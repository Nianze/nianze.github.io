  "content": "Some of my early clarinet cover is collected here in this article.\nWhy I launched the clarinet cover project In the summer of 2015, I started recording my clarinet cover inspired by ShonHayashi when I accidentally found his Youtube channel. At that time, actually, I haven\u0026rsquo;t touched my clarinet for a long time, partially due to my old opinion that clarinet is such a classical instrument that it is never a good fit for performing mordern style music.\nAnd I changed my opinion since I heard ShonHayashi\u0026rsquo;s clarinet cover on Vocaloid then.\n\u0026ldquo;Whoa! He plays the clarinet so well, why not to have a try muself just like him?\u0026rdquo;\nIn my mind, clarinet is not as expressive as violin or piano: the voice character of clarinet feels like silk, so it is hard to handle music with too strong emotions - maybe that\u0026rsquo;s why it is hard to see clarinet in Rock music :). However, it\u0026rsquo;s worth a try for music with elegant and sweet styles. Especially a good fit to imitate human voice1.\nSo, since I happen to know how to play this instrument, why not to have fun with it, and play some music that once touched me?\nListen to the Clarinet by sherrae78, on DeviantArt. My early covers in summer of 2015 At that moment, I did not know how to transcribe a sheet on my own, so I simply picked some of my favorite covers from ShonHayashi. All of these clarinet sheets below are transcribed by him.\n地球最後の告白を Let it go Jenga (ジェンガ) Vogel im Käfig ODDS \u0026amp; ENDS Reference from what Mozart wrote to Stadler \u0026ldquo;Never should I have thought that a clarinet could be capable of imitating the human voice as it was imitated by you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n",
