The melody is peaceful and elegant, which is written by Youmi Kimura (木村 弓), a Japanese singer and lyre performer.\nActually, I choose this one because this is chosen as the library\u0026rsquo;s closing-door music when I\u0026rsquo;m a undergrad.\nEverytime the music is on, we know it is 10:00pm and it is time to go back to dorm. At that time I always prefer to stay as late as possible in the library until the guard cruising around to drive me away. If the assignment is still not yet finished and deadline is approaching, I might even decided to go to the lab building around, finishing the remaining part.\nSometimes when I stepping out of the library building, the Big Dipper lied right ahead of me on the sky, and I would wear my headphones, turn on the music, and ride my bycicle back to the dorm. On the way, thinking about everything, past and future, I could only felt the wind.\nAnd all those days are spirited away:\n",
