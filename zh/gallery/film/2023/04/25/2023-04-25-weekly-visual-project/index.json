Kentmere Pan 400, on the other hand, shows much more grainy noise.\nCompare to Septon, I prefer Schneider Xenon for B\u0026amp;W film photoghrapy, and will reserve Septon for color works in the future. This is also my first time using the lovely Voigtlander Nokton 40 f1.4 for film, and love its sharp in-focus performance as well as classic bokeh rendering ability. This lens really shines in film.\n",
