Kentmere Pan 400 in Nikon FE2 + Voigtlander DKL Septon 50 f2
Arista EDU 100 in Hexar RF + Voigtlander Nokton 40 f1.4
<!--more-->

## My thoughts

Arista Edu 100 performed surprisingly well this time, with much fewer noise than my expectation. Kentmere Pan 400, on the other hand, shows much more grainy noise.

Compare to Septon, I prefer Schneider Xenon for B&W film photoghrapy, and will reserve Septon for color works in the future. This is also my first time using the lovely Voigtlander Nokton 40 f1.4 for film, and love its sharp in-focus performance as well as classic bokeh rendering ability. This lens really shines in film.
